Preclass Preparation
====

You will need to install a few applications on your computer for this course, set up what's called your *development environment*, and create SSH keys, or *Secure Shell* keys for access to GitHub.

Instructions are provided for Mac and Windows computers, the two operating systems officially supported by this course material.  If you are using Linux then you already know how to setup things like NodeJS and Git :)

If you are not familiar with the command line, expect to spend a couple hours on this.

Refer to the [**00-02-mac-setup**](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-backend/blob/master/00-preparation/00-02-mac-setup.md) or [**00-03-win-setup**](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-backend/blob/master/00-preparation/00-03-win-setup.md) file for additional instructions depending on your computer.
